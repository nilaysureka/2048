# About 2048
* 2048 is a popular puzzle game where the player slides numbered tiles on a grid.

## Gameplay
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. 
- The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile.

2048 has always been one of my favorite games growing up. It might seem simple at first, but building it presents some interesting challenges.
